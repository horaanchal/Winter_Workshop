To make sure the code ran properly, I created a dummy account on twitter and ran the collection and analysis script through it to make sure the code runs correctly. 
The dummy account consisting of very few tweets made it extremely easy for me to debug/format the code

user-analysis.py
``````````````````````````
the python script user-analysis.py consists of the code for collection and of data from a user's twitter feed(SrBachchan) and stores the tweets (100) in a file named SrBachchan_tweets.csv

SrBachchan_tweets.csv
``````````````````````````
this is the csv where the python program dumps the tweets it collects

univariate_X.R and bivariate_X.R	(X = 1,2,3)
``````````````````````````
these are the scripts for the data analysis part of the tasks
